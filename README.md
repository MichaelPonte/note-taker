This project is an application that allows a user to write and create notes.
The application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

When starting the application, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
On the notes page, the user is presented with previously saved notes on the left-hand column, and a fieild to create new notes on the right.
After entering a title and associated note, the user can save the note by clicking the save icon in the navigation bar.
Clicking on an existing note will display the note on the right column.
Clicking the "+" icon in the navigation bar will allow the user to enter a new note.
After notes have been created, the user can click on the associated trash icon on the note to remove it from the list and database.
